## Compatibility

Tested working on the "Legacy" view of Microsoft Outlook for Mac Version 16.73 (23051401) with a Microsoft 365 subscription. If you click the "Try the 'New' Outlook" button to use the new view, the script may return empty results.(Update: after toggling to legacy and back to the new view, the script works and returns results)
